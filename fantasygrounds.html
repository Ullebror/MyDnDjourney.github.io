          We started to use Fantasy Grounds when we started a bigger campaign.
          There happened to be a huge sale on steam for the virtual tabletop and it was nice that all the different modules that our DM bought would be actually his property,
          even if Fantasy Grounds would go down. That meant that if he bought the different modules, he basically has the rights to a digital copy of the Wizards of the Coast Dungeongs &amp; Dragons books. 
        <br>

          Fantasy Grounds has a lot of possibilities and in a way it even includes some coding that could be considered a bit similar to CSS or HTML, maybe even some that could be compared to javascript. 
          At this point we all wanted to learn how to create characters and our DM wanted to tackle a bigger campaign. I feel that learning Fantasy Grounds was much harder than Roll20, but after we got the gist of it,
          it felt a lot nicer to use and it felt great to play. Unfortunately I don't have any photos of our campaigns in Fantasy Grounds because they are server based and the DM is hosting the servers,
          so I can't just get in to take a screenshot. But here is a picture as a placeholder until I can take a screenshot myself.

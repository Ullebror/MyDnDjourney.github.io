    <p>
      Hello and welcome to my DnD journey! It all started with <a href="fate.html"> Fate</a> in 2014 or 2015, so I have played TTRPGs for 7 years or so.
      Back then one of my friends was very interested in DnD, but he figured that heading straight in to DnD might be hard for people that were completely
      new to the world of TTRPGs, so he found Fate as a possible chance to have an easier beginning.

    <p>
      The idea of this page is to document my journey to DnD and tell a little bit about the different games and campaigns we have had through the years.
      There is a <a href="dnd_explanations.html">Page for terms</a> that I suggest that you check out if you have trouble understanding some words!

  <aside class="item4">Right
    <p> I could put a basic DnD picture here probably</p>

  <footer class="item5">Footer
    <p>I haven't decided what should be in the footer, maybe some silly facts?</p>

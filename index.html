    <h1> My DnD journey </h1>
      
    <p class="bordered">
        I'm planning for the future and I'm going to prepare this lessons assignment with the final project of Digi-Intro in mind.
        So I will list things I'm going to use in that here so I can come and check what I was planning back then.
        I will also use at least some of the pictures I'm using here in the final project. 
        So this site will be pretty simple compared unless this will actually be the one we start with later on. 
        The idea of this site is to tell you about my history with the pen and paper tabletop rpg Dungeons and Dragons.</p>

        If I may suggest, I think it would be wise for you to read the <a href="dnd_explanations.html"> DnD Terms&nbsp;</a> page that I have, because I won't be explaining terms in my text to keep it flowing. </p>

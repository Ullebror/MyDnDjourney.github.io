        <h3>Fate</h3>
        <p class="fate_paragraph">
          When we started to play tabletop RPG we played mostly Fate and we were playing face to face. 
          We basically had one-shot games that were for example a game in fantasy world, where we made very silly characters on purpose 
          or a cyberpunk game that pretty much had a similar fate. 
        <br>
        <br>
          Fate is a simple TTRPG, where the dice are d6 and and the markings on them are +, - or nothing. Each marking is on the die twice. The player 
          rolls four dice on their turn and each + counts as +1, each empty side counts as 0 and - counts as -1. The characters also have skills that give
          bonus depending on what you roll for. The game has a ladder that describes your success, the highest is +8 legendary and the lowest -2 terrible.
          There is a possibility that the character rolls higher or lower than what the ladder has, and the groups can invent their own descriptors for the rolls
          that go higher or lower. The game works very much with the rule of cool and the most important thing is to have fun!

        <br>
        <br>
          After we got the hang of the basic idea of a tabletop RPG, we started to talk about playing actual DnD and we had come to the conclusion, 
          that trying to get all of us in the same place would be pretty much impossible if we wanted to keep a nice bi-weekly schedule. That meant we had to find a way to play remotely.
          We discussed about possibilities and our first decision was <a href="roll20.html"> Roll20</a>.

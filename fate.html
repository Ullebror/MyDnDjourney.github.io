    <h2> Face to face Fate &amp; moving to DnD </h2>

    <p class="bordered">
        When we started to play tabletop RPG we played mostly Fate and we were playing face to face. 
        We basically had one-shot games that were for example a game in fantasy world, where we made very silly characters on purpose or a cyberpunk game that pretty much had a similar fate.

        After we got the hang of the basics of any tabletop RPG, we started to talk about playing actual DnD and we had come to the conclusion, 
        that trying to get all of us in the same place would be pretty much impossible if we wanted to keep a nice bi-weekly schedule. That meant we had to find a way to play remotely.
        We discussed about possibilities and our first decision was <a href="roll20.html"> Roll20</a>.</p>

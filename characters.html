        <h3> Werakdrul Chaostank </h3>
        <p> 
          Dwarf Life Cleric. He was a premade character from the Mines of Phandelver module. Mines of Phandelver
          is a starter module to get to know the ropes, it uses only the basic ruleset and we couldn't make big decisions
          about our characters. Werakdrul was an old soldier, who ended up adventuring. His journey ended to a young 
          green dragon. We still didn't know much about the game and the idea was to get acquinted with the game, so we didn't write
          intricate backgrounds then.
        </p>
        <h3> Iantorin </h3>
        <p> 
          Half-elf Hexblade Warlock. Iantorin had a twin brother named Ianril who was a Paladin &lpar;Yes, the names are confusing on purpose&rpar;. 
          Iantorin was jealous of his brother, because he was strong and as liked a half-elf could be. Iantorin wished he could be
          more like his brother.
        <br>
          Then one day they were playing on the beach and he found a weird rusty blade that he took home.
          The next night he saw a dream, where something asked him if he wished for power. Iantorin answered yes.
          In the morning the blade was gone and Iantorin first thought that his brother had taken the blade. It strained their 
          relationship for a while but it passed and he didn't see the blade for a long time. When his brother left to join the ranks of Paladins,
          The voices came back and gave him power to match his brother. The life Iantorin had lived made him cunning and a little bit brash at times,
          and to help his mother he decided to do caravan protection work. When he got a bit of a name for himself on being a good caravan guard,
          an agent of Zhentarim approached him and asked him to work for them. 
        <br>
          After a while of working for the Zhentarim Iantorin got a mission where he ended up working with his brother Ianril,
          Ianril and a few other people. Iantorin was outed as a Zhentarim agent to his friends quite early in the campaign and he
          decided to renounce the Zhentarim. There were a few assassination attempts later on because of this, but since they failed
          miserably, Iantorin was able to live his life well. Iantorin got the weapon Giant Slayer, which he made his Hexblade bond with.
          I'm not going to spoil the Campaign story of Storm King's Thunder, but we managed quite well.
        <br>
          The group even had to fight Iantorin's Patron Slarkrethel, but we ran away because it was quite creepy. After the events
          of the campaign, Iantorin decided that he wanted to rid himself of Slarkrethel and he decided to go find people, who would
          like to kill the kraken.
        </p>
        <h3> Murkub </h3>
        <p> 
          Orc Druid, Circle of Wildfire. Murkub is an easy going young orc shaman. His clan Tribe of the Fire Crow are nomads that sometimes
          work and deal with villages or smaller cities. He is trained by the head shaman and he is a contender for being the next one.
          One day suddenly some weird creatures attacked the tribe and Murkub got separated from them. When he was wandering around he found
          an apple orchard and decided to eat an apple since he was hungry. He was then apprehended by the local guards and sent to a work camp.

          He escaped the work camp with his newfound friends and they are still on this adventure. They have been excused of their crimes so they
          don't need to worry about being sent back to the camp anymore, so that is good.

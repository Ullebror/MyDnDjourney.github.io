          We used Roll20 when we started to play DnD. Roll20 was an easy decision in the beginning, because we weren't sure how much we were going to invest time to the game and Roll20 was free.
          Our DM did most of the job in Roll20 I think, since he needed to get all the maps and enemy tokens and everything set. I think he even made our character sheets this time around. 
          All we had to do was find a character portrait and then we could put stuff in our quick bar. 
          It's been quite a long time since that time so 
          I don't recall how we did that, but I do have a photo of our last battle that ended in an almost complete <a href="https://dnd4.fandom.com/wiki/Total_party_kill">Total party kill </a>.

      <h4> First taste of DnD </h4>
      <p class="roll20_paragraph"> 
        We decided to try DnD out with an introductory module called Lost Mines of Phandelver.
        None of us had any experience about the game so it fit us well, since the module also gave pre-created characters to choose from. I played <a href="characters.html"> Werakdrul Chaostank </a>, 
        who was a dwarf life cleric, if I remember correctly. It was interesting to see how the game worked and I feel that it was kind of difficult to play a healer character,
        because I had to constantly think between using spell slots to deal damage or saving the slots to get someone who was knocked unconscious up with healing spells.

      <p class="roll20_paragraph">
        The game itself was interesting and there was lot to learn and many interesting things to see.
        I liked the combat and it was fun to try to learn social interactions and basically trying to improv discussions through a character.
        Unfortunately, our journey ended to a young green dragon that killed us. Well, actually one of my friends was playing a wizard that managed to teleport away and he lived for another day.
        After this campaign, we decided that we were ready to invest a bit more money to our games, and we decided to use <a href="fantasygrounds.html">Fantasy Grounds</a>.
